### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
- An Ubuntu-based VPS with SSH access (For this case I will be hosting the server on localhost with VBox)
- Medium/Advanced knowledge of the Linux command line (Deploy a server from the terminal is not easier than do it on Windows)

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
   ```
