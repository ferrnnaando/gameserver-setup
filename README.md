# Ubuntu VPS Setup Guide

Whether you're new to VPS administration or looking to optimize your server's performance and security, this guide has got you covered.

## Installing on FiveM

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
- An Ubuntu-based VPS with SSH access (For this case I will be hosting the server on localhost with VBox)
- Medium/Advanced knowledge of the Linux command line (Deploy a server from the terminal is not easier than do it on Windows)

### Step 1: Setting Up Your VPS

# Running Localhost

If you are running VBox you will have to make a few extra steps.

1. We will need to port forward to let VBox able to connect via SSH. This step is not strongly required but is highly recommended.

Right-click on your VM > Settings > Network > Adapter 1 (Generally is this) > Port Forwardaing
